# Fantasy Football Player Performance Predictor

The goal of this project is to project a player's fantasy football score. The notebook takes into account a wide range of factors, drawing on historical data from the last 50 years. It takes into account not only player statistics, but also the team as a whole as well as the opponent. To be sure, players often do not perform predictably. Thus, a high standard deviation for prediction error is to be expected. This holds true for player projections from experts like ESPN. Nevertheless, many who play fantasy football rely on this projection as a baseline when selecting players.
